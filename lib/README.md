# WineBar
This is a CLI app from scraped data using open-uri and nokogiri. It goes 2 levels deep by crawling the site when the user types in the proper input. 
#=>
 Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/wine_bar`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.



## Installation
As of current this gem is for academic purposes only. You may clone this repo and use it as you see fit. 

The execute file is './bin/run'. You must give bash permission to execute this file with 'chmod +x run' within the terminal for the run file in the bin directory 

The environment 'env.rb' file within the lib directory has all the files necessary for the gem to run. Nokogiri is a separate gem needed as well. 

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:


```ruby
gem 'wine_bar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wine_bar

## Usage

This gem is best for practice with scraping and crawling using nokogiri. You may use it for better understanding ob object oriented ruby.
